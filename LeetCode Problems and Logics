we are given glasses ith row has i no of glasses and each glass can store 1 cup of wine . else wine will be poured to left and 
right glass . we will be given some quantity of wine and we have to find jth glass of ith row will contain what amount of wine . 
following is the code . 

double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
        vector<double>currRow(1,poured);

        for(int i=0;i<=query_row ; i++)
        {
            vector<double>nextRow(i+2,0);
            for(int j=0;j<=i;j++)
            {
                if(currRow[j] >=1 )
                {
                    nextRow[j] +=(currRow[j]-1)/2.0;
                    nextRow[j+1]+=(currRow[j]-1)/2.0;
                    currRow[j]=1;
                }
            }
            if(i != query_row )
            currRow=nextRow;
        }
        return currRow[query_glass];
    }
